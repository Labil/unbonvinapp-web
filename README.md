Un bon vin app
===============

A wine database web app meant to accompany an android app that I'm concurrently developing. The page is in Norwegian, because all the data in the database is in Norwegian.

For the frontend I've used __jQuery__ and __Handlebars.js__, and a lot of handwritten javascript for practice.
The backend api is written in __php__ with __mysql__ to query the database.

I've got a list of stuff I wanna fix, if you can think of anything else or discover bugs etc, please let me know :)

TODOS:
x Data visualisation with __D3.js__
x Login system <-----uh husk å kanskje gjøre det FØR denne repoen blir public:p
x Pagination for queries that yield a ton of wines
x Different stylesheets for different sizes n stuff / more flexible layout
x Rewrite the backend api to use mysqli
x Effect in adress bar to show what sub page the user is on (even tho it's a one page app).
x Testing
x Refactoring of code
x Shortcuts to search for the "best and cheapest" wines or the newest added wines
