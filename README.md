Un bon vin app
===============
The title translates to "A good wine app" and is a pun on one of the phrases we were thought in french class for learning to pronounce all the nasal sounds ^^

A wine database web app meant to accompany an android app that I'm concurrently developing. The page is in Norwegian, because all the data in the database is in Norwegian.

For the frontend I've used __jQuery__ and __Handlebars.js__, and a lot of handwritten javascript for practice.
The backend api is written in __php__ with __mysql__ to query the database.

I've got a list of stuff I wanna fix, if you can think of anything else or discover bugs etc, please let me know :)

TODOS:

x Data visualisation with __D3.js__

x Improve login system.

x Pagination for queries that yield a ton of wines? Runs pretty smooth without, though.

x Testing

x Refactoring of code



Currently live at http://plainbrain.net/unbonvinapp/  <--- this version doesn't require you to log in. But please play nice with the database anyway :)
